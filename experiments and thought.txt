SCCL 
* Allowed to have different model
* Allowed to take CLS_use as an argument. (this allow user to use CLS token for embedding instead of using aggregated means) 
* returning both assignments and embeddings 

visualization 
* Umap included in the section for visualization

- autoregressive

Made a new flow chart (mainly focused on general flow of main model) 

***** Meaning of the arguments that are passed 
***** what it returns 

***** News cluster data folder is made 

time 10:55
***** closest distance 
2개의 column이 쥐어쥠. 

하나씩 clustering 한후
일단 각각의 augment한다?! 

방법1. 합치기 
방법2. 따로 

preprocessed by erasing all the punctuation, numbers,

일단 따로 해서 각각의 결과를 test해봄 

실험1. title만 가지고 내보기 --> Myungsoo (contents) 
       내용만 가지고 내보기 --> Youngok (title) 

실험2. concat --> myungsoo (augmenting) 


Title took an hour 
Contents taking ?!?!?!

contextual augmentation takes long time to augment :( 

I can also return the distance value so that when comparing title and contents I can choose between the two by looking at the distance. 

concatenate title and contents and augment it seperately (what I can do for later) 

I can use it for checking whether the model is running properly or not 

() == index number 

10개 종합 entertainment

0 == Business (3, 4, 70, 79, 85, 93, 98, 99, 100, 102, 103)
1 == Entertainment (39, 62, 64, 67, 68, 80, 84, 142, 147, 159 )
2 == Politics (12, 14, 18, 19, 53, 54, 65, 81, 89, 91, 101)
3 == sports (59997, 0, 38, 72, 88, 94, 96, 115, 116, 118, 121, 122)
4 == Tech (52, 73, 74, 83, 92, 97, 110, 119, 123, 125)
5 == World (16, 29, 50, 61, 63, 66 ,69, 71, 75, 77, 78, 82)

among 6 categories I have choose one by looking at the content and title of news (business, entertainment,politics, sports, tech, world)

 ***** Observation 
Entertainment is harder to capture (its closely related to politics and sports) 
Maybe I have to do the clustering once again for these three types Making a distinction will be a key factor.
